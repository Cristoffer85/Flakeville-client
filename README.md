# Project: Flakeville Ski Resort Application (Client) - with PowderTracker¬Æ

## Description

The client application for Flakeville Ski Resort. This application serves as a client for corresponding server 
https://github.com/Flakeville-server which is built in Java on primarily framework Spring Boot.

The application is mainly built in Javascript with HTML and CSS, and frameworks React and Vite (.jsx) as help.

The applications main purpose is meant to be the ultimate Ski Resort application for both managers, employees and guests at Sn√∂fj√§llby Ski Resort.

* Managers can handle typical and overall employee and guest requests,
* Employees can handle the daily running of the resort as well the common store, and some of its own data.
* Guests (Users) can book a stay, rent equipment, book ski lessons, and see the current weather and snow conditions.



## Installation

1. Make sure you have the server version downloaded and running on your local machine.  
```https://github.com/Cristoffer85/SnofjallbyWithPT-Backend``` Also follow the instructions there to correctly set it up, and start that server.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Make sure every component containing API endpoints in this application is correctly set up to match the servers URL (I know, later it will be set in a common API.jsx or similar for correct and better structure).  
Right now they are:


    - components/Navbar.jsx
    - components/Products.jsx
    - components/SignUp.jsx
    - components/SignIn.jsx
   

    - pages/AdminAccount.jsx
    - pages/EmployeeAccount.jsx
    - pages/UserAccount.jsx
    - pages/Weather.jsx
    - pages/Cart.jsx
    - pages/Store.jsx

4. Navigate to sf-frontend folder and type ```npm run dev``` to start the application. View in your browser at ```http://localhost:5173```

## Usage

The application is built to be used by three different types of users, ADMIN, EMPLOYEE and GUEST (User). Navigate around the application by clicking on the different links in the Navbar and pages overall to test various functions. More detailed info can be found further down on features.
